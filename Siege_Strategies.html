                <p>
                    Having points placed in the enginner skill, be it in your character or in a companion, decrease the time needed to finish buildings in towns and siege weapons, with zero points invested it can take you around 4 days to start a siege, at max level 6 hours is enough to build everything, making your troops stay feed and with high morale until the raid starts.
                </p>

            <div id="strategie-2">
                <h2>
                    Vulnerables targets
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world is big and events keep happening all the time, be it a war campaign or a feast, keeping an eye for oportunities and chosing the right places to attack is one of the way to increase your chances of winning and reducing your losses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you talk with lords about wars, you can know with factios they are at war with, and wait for a military campign to strike a castle or raid villages far away from they objective, making them unable to go back in time to defend their lands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After every tournament, the lord of the castle gives a feast, and all the lords partake in it, if you talk with the ringleaders in the arena you can know where they are happening and use this to your advantage.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="strategie-3">
                <h2>
                    Don't fight alone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you are already a monarch, mercenary or vassal to a faction, talk with the other lords so you can attack together, this make your numbers higher and keep you siege camp safer form external attacks, and always let the other lords attack first, this makes their troops go first, keeping yours as a last resort.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="strategie-4">
                <h2>
                    Play around the castle fortress
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you're attacking, avoid narrow spaces, send your infantry in waves, avoiding bottlenecks in the various narrow spaces of the castle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attacking the inside of the castle takes time, be patient, use infantry with the most durable shields, like Rhodoks Sargeants and Nord Huscarls, in the front, as the archers will start attacking them at first, and take your archers to the highest place you can find (Don't go too far, your archers still need to hit the soldiers in the castle walls)
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're defending, use your archer around the walls, they will kill most of the infantry trying to climb, because they will bottleneck the entrance, the narrow spaces are perfect for you to defend, use some infantry to prevent stragglers from entering, and the archers will do the rest. Defending is way easier than attacking.
