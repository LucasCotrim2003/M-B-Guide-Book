            <h2>
                Nord Huscarl
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Nord Huscarls are the strongest Nord infantry and the only tier six troop in the game. Given their superior equipment, including the Huscarl's Round Shield, they are often regarded as the strongest melee unit available. A good number of Huscarls in a formation can even be superior to equal numbers of Swadian Knights.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    A notable downside to this line of troops is that they take an extremely long time to train, so patience will be necessary. Their high level can help to some degree, as defeating four Huscarls at a Training Field during sparring will grant most other infantry a very large amount of experience, but will not be a simple task for newer characters.

            <h2>
                Rhodok Sharpshooter
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Rhodok Sharpshooters are Rhodok crossbowmen who have highly polished skills, and are the strongest crossbow-wielding troop in the game. They are armed with a fearsome Siege Crossbow and Steel Bolt combination, which can take down any enemy with any armor in one or two hits. They also always carry a Board Shield. This equipment setup allows for some very powerful strategies.

            <div>
                <p>
                    While being great crossbowmen, Sharpshooters are also great at self-defense. In fact, their skills are on par with veteran infantry of the other kingdoms. Their Ironflesh and Power Strike skills are impressively high. Do keep in mind, however, that their Mail with Tunic armor is mediocre at best.

            <h2>
                Swadian Knight
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Swadian Knights are a heavy cavalry unit. They are the strongest cavalry unit in Mount&Blade, though they have been rivaled in Warband with the addition of Sarranid Mamlukes. The Mamluke is a very similar unit, with small differences including wages and stats, and of course, choice of equipment.
                </p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    One of the most effective tactics to use with the Swadian Knights is to have your infantry hold ground, creating a defensive wall. When the enemy are advancing towards your infantry, tell your cavalry to follow you and flank to the left or right until you are behind the coming enemy. When they are within charging distance, charge both your cavalry and your infantry at the same time. Timing here can be very important, as ideally both troop divisions need to hit the enemy simultaneously. This attack will greatly weaken the enemy as their attention will be split in two directions at once, halving their combat effectiveness.

                <p>
                    These units are generally considered to be the best bow-wielders in the game, and can unleash a hail of arrows that will destroy opposing infantry. Their damage per second is higher than that of the crossbow-wielding Rhodok Sharpshooters, due to their five ranks of Power Draw, which apply a 170% multiplier to their bows, and they shoot about twice as quickly as Siege Crossbows.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                     They are an inferior choice for attacking and defending castles when compared to the Sharpshooters, as they lack the staying power necessary to survive long sieges. This disadvantage is not present in field battles due to the battles' shorter duration. There, archers rarely have enough time to unload their entire quiver, making total possible damage output less important than rate of fire, raw damage per second, accuracy, and mobility.
