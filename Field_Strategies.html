                <h2>
                    Hill Advantage and Defensive formation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Position your infantry at the front, archers behind, and cavalry on the flanks, all on elevated terrain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Height gives archers better range and visibility, while infantry can absorb charges. This strategie excel specially in archer focused warbands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    cavalry will go after the enemy archers and hunt the remaining infantry when the enemy start retreating. Depending on the level of your archers, your infantry can be at low levels, in an ideal scenario, they enemy will retreat before reaching your infantry line.
                </p>

            <div id="field-strategie-2">
                <h2>
                    Cavalry Flanking & Rear Charges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hold your cavalry back until the enemy is engaged, then send them around to hit archers or the rear line. This makes impossible for the infantry to defend the archers, and very dificulty for them to react to the rear attacks due to the cavalry superior mobility, rendering the archers useless for the rest of the battle, as they will be decimated by the cavalry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this strategie makes the battle go a lot smootther and reduce the number of casualties, it's important to know that you still need good infantry and archers, because even low level infantry with spears can cause a lot of problems to cavalry units.

            <div id="field-strategie-3">
                <h2>
                    Swadian Knight Charge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you just want to enjoy the player combat system of the game and forget about the strategie aspect, you can invest in an warband solely composed of swadian Knights, they are the best cavalry unit in the game, but still poses as good infantry unit, having one the best heavy armor in the game, and decent one handed weapons, so if his horse end up dying in a fight, he can still be used as infantry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep in mind that while this unit can be an "all-rounder", he will suffer a lot against high level infantry, such as nord huscarl and rhodoks sargeants, and because they are one of the most expensive unit in the game, invest in enterprizes around calradia so you can maintain your army even in times of peace.

                    In the end, managing your troops with the f1-f6 keys, keeping your troops at a high level, and adapting as the battles progresses is the key factor to win with zero casualties or lose miserably, you will end up using all strategies as you play the game, every battle is different, be it the terrain or the enemys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to use what you have at hand, sometimes you can't find good gear at the start, sometimes you make mistakes that make you start over, keep in mind that adaptability is key and every battle is winnable with enought pacience, strategie and luck.
